# Headbanger's Manual
### First Project for Code Institute

The main idea behind this site are recommendations for people that have just gotten into metal music genre.

## Demo

https://xasthar.github.io/FirstProject-CodeInstitute/

## UX

A potential guest can navigate through the navbar to find recommendations on three sub-pages.

### Strategy

I was aiming to provide easy road for the user to understand how complex this music genre can be.

### Scope

I tried to put in as much descriptions as I can without overloading guests with information.

### Structure

Through the main page guests can read some of my favourite quotes and the sub-pages have images depicting artists on stage.

### Skeleton

Unfortunately through development the design changed as i was learning more about what I can and what I have time to do.
So the original wireframes serve here no purpose.

### Surface

I think that the black and gray background contrast nicely with the colors of images.

## Technologies

* Html5
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Bootstrap extension

## Features
-
The site in it's sub-pages has 3 difficulty stages with nine youutube embeds as examples in 3 different genres.

## Future Plans

I'm planning to diversify the content by adding more sub-genres either in the existing sub-pages or making new ones.
You can find a WIP page and blocked link to different media like books or movies that i'm going to finish in my own free time.

## Testing

Couple of invited guests have tested the site positively in different scenarios also providing me useful feedback about some elements of the site.
